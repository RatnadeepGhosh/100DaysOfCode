Saw this particular question on a website, and i was intrigued and excited at the same time to try and solve the problem.

The problem read: average a coin toss simulation while printing out the outcome, only if there is a repitition of either head or tails three times in succession.

It was tricky though, but i learned a lot today. 


Day 2 over cheers......
