# In this challenge we will write a program to convert an angle
#  from degrees toraidans or from radians to degrees based on 
# the userâ€™s choice. Our program will:

#    Display a menu of options to the end user.
#    Ask the end-user to choose an option from the menu.
#    Ask the end-user to input an angle in the required unit.
#    Calculate and output the angle in the alternative angle unit.
